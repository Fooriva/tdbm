### Is this used in production?

Hell yes! TheCodingMachine has been using TDBM as far back as 2006 in a lot of its projects.

TDBM is well tested, used and stable. It will not fit anyone needs however. If you want to learn more, check out [our comparison with Doctrine](comparison_with_doctrine.md). Dependending on the use case, we use both ORMs at TheCodingMachine.


### Where are the other TDBM versions?

Did you notice that the [TDBM Github repository](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/tdbm) starts with TDBM 5?

This is because earlier version were part of the [Mouf 2 framework](http://mouf-php.com), and therefore in a [Mouf specific repository here](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/database.tdbm).

The Mouf Github repository goes back to TDBM v3.

TDBM v2 was part Mouf 1, hosted on a SVN repository (it was the dark ages of the pre-composer eon)

TDBM v1 was a single PHP file (yes yes...) copied from project to project and now long gone (the first version goes back as far as 2006) :)
